This script processes and downloads the ResStock 2025 dataset.
The 2025 dataset has different root than the previous versions.
Therefore, there are some adjustments needed for the Analysis.py
source code located in ~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ochre/Analysis.py

REQUIREMENTS:

- Download the OR_upgrades.csv file and make sure it is in the same 
path as this script.

- Make sure to copy Analysis.py in this folder to ~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ochre/
